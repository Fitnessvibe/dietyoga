Yoga is also an excellent form of exercise for improving cardiovascular health. Certain types of yoga, such as Vinyasa or Power Yoga, can get your heart rate up and improve your overall cardiovascular fitness. Additionally, regular yoga practice has been shown to help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.

If you struggle with sleep issues, regular yoga practice may also be able to help. Studies have shown that practicing yoga before bed can help improve sleep quality and reduce the time it takes to fall asleep. Additionally, certain yoga postures, such as the Corpse Pose, can help calm the mind and prepare the body for sleep.
